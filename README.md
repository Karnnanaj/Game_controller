Microcontroller(both Arduino and Pi pico) based Steering wheel with paddle shifters and pedals. The lastest version uses Pi pico(Adiy fly RP2040 Pico Board) for it higher clock speed. Unlike other steering wheel this does not use an expensive encoder, the whole idea is using a cheap encoder to achieve a accurate and fast resposive output. There are two steps to achieve this, the higher clock speed and auto calibrating center switch, With both a very good steering setup can be made.
The documentation is not complete. I will update this by the end of July 2025.
